<h2>Styleguide</h2>
<p class="explantory-text">So that all our project sheets look the same and read as if they are written with one voice; here are some guidelines.</p>
<h3>General</h3>
<p>As a base we use the Economist style guide. Variations from that are detailed below.</p>
<h3>Measurements</h3>
<p>All measurements are to be in SI units or SI derivatives.</p>
<p>Areas are in m&sup2;</p>
</p>Never use M&sup2;, M2, m2, sqm, sq.m etc.</p>
<p>loads more stylistic ranting to come here!</p>
