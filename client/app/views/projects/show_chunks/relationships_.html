<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p class="explantory-text">This is depricated. If you come to this and it's empty; don't fill it in.</p>
<p class="explantory-text">This records the key relationships we had during the project and the state that they were left in. If person X at company Y loves us, but person Z got really annoyed then record that sort of thing here. This is so in future we can go back and find out what not to say or what to talk up. E.g. if we left it in a screaming argument then we need to patch things up before we ask for a favour!</p>
